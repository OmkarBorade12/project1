Description:
This Python script is a simple Mad Libs generator that prompts the user for various inputs to create humorous and creative sentences. The user will be asked to provide a place, two adjectives, an animal, and two verbs.

It then constructs two sentences using formatted strings (`f-strings`) that incorporate the user's inputs.
Finally, the script prints the completed sentences to the console.
